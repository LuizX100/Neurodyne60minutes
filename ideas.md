  **Design Movement**: Editorial / News Broadcast Aesthetic
  **Core Principles**:
  - **Authority & Credibility**: Mimic the visual language of established news organizations (CNN, Fox, etc.) to borrow trust.
  - **Urgency**: Use visual cues like "Breaking News" banners, countdown timers, and "Live" indicators to drive immediate action.
  - **Simplicity**: High contrast, legible typography, and a focused layout that directs all attention to the video content.
  - **Social Proof**: Heavily emphasize user engagement (comments, likes) and media endorsements to validate the offer.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary Red (#C41E3A)**: Used for the header and "Breaking News" elements to signal urgency, importance, and alert.
  - **Stark White & Light Gray (#F0F2F5)**: Backgrounds that replicate the clean, content-focused look of social media and news sites.
  - **Black & Dark Gray**: For high-readability text, grounding the content in a serious, factual tone.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Single Column / Centralized Focus**: The entire page is designed to funnel the user's eye down a single path: Headline -> Video -> Social Proof -> Comments.
  - **Above the Fold Priority**: The most critical elements (Headline, Video) are immediately visible without scrolling.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **"Breaking News" Ticker**: A visual motif that implies current, unfolding events.
  - **Facebook-style Comments**: A familiar UI pattern that users instinctively trust as "real" user feedback.
  - **Countdown Timer**: A persistent reminder of scarcity.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Passive Consumption**: The user is encouraged to watch and read, with minimal friction or complex interactions until the CTA is revealed.
  - **Pseudo-Live Feel**: Elements that suggest real-time updates (timestamps, "just now" comments).

  **Animation**:
  - **Subtle Pulse**: On the "Live" or "Recording" indicators.
  - **Ticker Scroll**: Smooth horizontal scrolling for news tickers.
  - **Fade-in**: For the CTA button after a specific time (if applicable).

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Helvetica Neue** or **Arial** (Bold/Black) - Standard, no-nonsense fonts used by major news outlets.
  - **Body**: **Arial** or **Roboto** - Highly readable, familiar, and neutral.
